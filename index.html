                Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you
                know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most
                times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because
                of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

                Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that
                show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to
                make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She
                starred in one of the ones that became nothing.

                Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than
                mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same
                way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it
                may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.
