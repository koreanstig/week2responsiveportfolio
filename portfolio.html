                    become a web developer.
                    Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my
                    name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting
                    outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what
                    you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for
                    an infant named Jeb.</p>

                    the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now,
                    I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide...
                    and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
                    snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.
